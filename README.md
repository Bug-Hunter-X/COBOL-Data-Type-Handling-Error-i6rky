This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programming related to data type handling.  The `bug.cob` file contains code that attempts to perform arithmetic operations on an alphanumeric field, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version with proper data type declarations and error handling.  This example highlights the importance of careful data type management in COBOL to avoid runtime errors and ensure program stability.
